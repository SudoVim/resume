const HACKERONE_DESCRIPTION = `
HackerOne acquired PullRequest and the PullRequest team. In the new HackerOne
"Code Review" team, I've continued to perform all of the same full stack
software development and technical lead duties as at PullRequest. In addition,
I took on several new product initiatives including SAST-directed
human-in-the-loop and AI-assisted code review variants. I've also branched out
into creating blog content to drive more traffic to our marketing site.

const HACKERONE_ESSAY = `
Working at a larger company grants us greater flexibility to refine our
products, thereby enhancing their alignment with the specific requirements of
enterprise clientele. Being part of a small, agile team enables us to swiftly
iterate on these concepts, all the while expanding our backend infrastructure
to accommodate additional use cases. This approach ensures continuous
improvement and support for our existing product suite.

Because I'm constantly focusing on innovative new use cases for the existing
code review software platform, I'm also collaborating with customers, internal
sales and marketing, and senior leadership - synthesizing the input from all of
these people into a cohesive product while maintaining clear lines of
communication with all of the stakeholders.

One of the more interesting projects in which I'm involved is overhauling the
old https://pullrequest.com marketing site to incorporate our new product
directions. This also includes daily blog content in which we take
narrowly-focused technical content, generate a blog post and image using AI,
then use our existing reviewer network to edit the articles to be coherant.
