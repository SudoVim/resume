const HACKERONE_DESCRIPTION = `
As the Technical Lead for the HackerOne "Code Review" team following the
acquisition of PullRequest, I have leveraged my extensive full stack
development expertise to continue advancing our technical goals. In this
leadership role, I have been instrumental in mentoring and guiding a dynamic
team of engineers and fostering an environment of continuous improvement. My
contributions have extended beyond traditional software development to
spearhead several key product initiatives, including a budget-friendly product
option that integrates Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and AI into a
new mechanism that decides which changes are more important to review. In
addition, I have taken a proactive role in content creation, developing
insightful blog content aimed at driving increased traffic to our marketing
site.

const HACKERONE_ESSAY = `
Working at a larger company grants me greater flexibility to refine our
products with experimental new features, thereby enhancing their alignment with
the specific requirements of enterprise clientele. In addition, being part of a
small, agile team inside that company, enables me to swiftly iterate on these
concepts, all the while expanding our backend infrastructure to accommodate
additional use cases. This approach ensures continuous improvement and support
for our existing product suite.

Because I'm constantly focusing on innovative new use cases for the existing
code review software platform, I'm also collaborating with customers, internal
sales and marketing, and senior leadership - synthesizing the input from all of
these people into a cohesive product while maintaining clear lines of
communication with all of the stakeholders.

One of the more interesting projects in which I'm involved is overhauling the
old https://pullrequest.com marketing site to incorporate our new product
directions. This also includes daily blog content in which we take
narrowly-focused technical content, generate a blog post and image using AI,
then use our existing reviewer network to edit the articles to be coherant.
